//
//			Solution found after 33 iterations.
//			The largest size of the stack was 3
//
//			Solution found after 76 iterations.
//			The largest size of the queue was 10
//
//			Solution found after 22 iterations.
//			The largest size of the stack was 14
//
//			Queue ran out of items after 66 iterations. No solution to maze.
//			The largest size of the queue was 2
//
//			Stack ran out of items after 66 iterations. No solution to maze.
//			The largest size of the stack was 2
//
//			Your code will be tested on all 10 mazes, both queue and stack methods.
//			The following for-loop will run both methods for all 10 files.
